# Blog Styling Enhancement Project

## Context
I have a personal portfolio website built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite that includes a markdown-based blog system. The current blog implementation works functionally but has poor visual design - it looks too narrow and basic, lacking the professional appearance of modern blog articles.

## Current Project Structure
- React app with blog components in `src/components/Blog/`
- Blog posts as markdown files in `src/data/posts/`
- Current styling in `src/App.css` using BEM methodology
- React Markdown for rendering with syntax highlighting
- Three blog posts: azure-fundamentals-journey.md, powershell-automation-tips.md, intune-device-management.md

## Required Transformations

### 1. Article Layout & Typography
- Transform narrow blog layout to professional article width (800px max-width)
- Implement proper typography hierarchy with larger, more readable fonts (18px base)
- Use serif font for body text (Georgia/Times) for better readability
- Improve line-height to 1.6-1.8 for optimal reading experience
- Add generous whitespace and padding around content (3rem padding)

### 2. Code Block Enhancements
- Make code blocks break out of content width for better visibility
- Implement modern syntax highlighting theme (GitHub Dark or VS Code style)
- Add proper styling for inline code with background highlighting
- Ensure code blocks are fully responsive

### 3. Article Structure Components
- Create professional article header with featured image area
- Add prominent article metadata (date, read time, tags)
- Implement table of contents generation from markdown headings
- Add article footer with author bio section
- Create navigation between previous/next posts

### 4. Enhanced Markdown Styling
- Style blockquotes as attractive callout boxes with left border
- Improve list styling with proper spacing and hierarchy
- Add figure/caption styling for images
- Create distinct styling for different heading levels (H1-H6)
- Add hover effects and better link styling

### 5. Visual Polish
- Add subtle shadows and card-like appearance to articles
- Implement reading progress indicator
- Create responsive design that works on mobile
- Add social sharing button placeholders
- Ensure consistent spacing throughout articles

## Files to Modify
- `src/components/Blog/BlogPost.tsx` - Main article layout and structure
- `src/App.css` - Add comprehensive blog article styling
- `src/components/Blog/BlogCard.tsx` - Improve preview card design
- Possibly create new components: `ArticleHeader.tsx`, `TableOfContents.tsx`

## Technical Requirements
- Maintain existing markdown rendering system with React Markdown
- Keep current routing structure and blog data management
- Ensure TypeScript compatibility
- Follow existing BEM CSS methodology
- Make responsive for mobile devices
- Optimize for readability and user experience

## Design Inspiration
Style the blog to look like professional tech blogs such as Stripe's blog, Next.js documentation, or dev.to articles - clean, readable, with excellent typography and generous whitespace.

## Specific Tasks
1. Redesign BlogPost component layout and structure
2. Create comprehensive CSS styling for article content
3. Implement enhanced markdown component rendering
4. Add article metadata and navigation components
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness
6. Test with existing blog posts to ensure proper rendering

Please implement these changes while preserving the existing markdown-based content system and maintaining the overall site architecture.
